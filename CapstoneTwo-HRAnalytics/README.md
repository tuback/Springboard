# IBM HR Analytics: Employee Attrition and Performance

## Overview

Employee attrition poses a significant challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, morale, and overall performance. The project aims to address this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze employee data and predict attrition probabilities. The objective is to identify key factors influencing attrition and develop actionable insights to improve employee retention strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the ["IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance"](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) dataset available on Kaggle. It contains various employee-related features such as age, education, job role, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.

## Methodology

The project followed a structured data science methodology, encompassing the following steps:

1. **Data Wrangling**: Ensuring the dataset is clean, complete, and ready for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Thoroughly exploring the dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships.

3. **Preprocessing and Training Data Development**: Preparing the dataset for model training and evaluation.

4. **Modeling**: Implementing various machine learning models to predict employee attrition based on the preprocessed dataset.

## Key Findings and Recommendations

- **Influential Factors**: Factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, relationship satisfaction, and years at the company significantly impact employee attrition rates.
  
- **Predictive Model Performance**: The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 89.9% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting employee attrition.
  
- **Retention Strategies**: Recommendations include enhancing work-life balance initiatives, developing career development programs, implementing employee engagement surveys, and offering competitive compensation packages.

## Further Research and Limitations

Opportunities for further research and improvement include incorporating additional data sources, exploring advanced machine learning techniques, conducting longitudinal studies, and addressing potential biases or limitations in the dataset.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into employee attrition and performance, offering actionable recommendations for organizations to enhance employee retention strategies and improve overall productivity.
